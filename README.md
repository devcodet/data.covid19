**OPEN COLABORATION**

TAIKAI

//Participate in this open collaboration effort to solve social Crisis and Challenges behind Coronavirus Epidemics.
//COVID-19 Open Challenge is an open collaboration effort in which volunteers, designers, students, researchers, computer scientists, health workers, startups, software developers, business developers and others will cooperate and produce creative solutions which can help fight against the current epidemic of COVID-19.
"We believe that it is good for groups at risk to stay at home at this time (indefinitely).

-> As such, we thought about creating a solution / application that allows risk groups to request a product / service and have helpers who can do it safely (with standards to be defined by specialists).
This allows to reduce iterations and mitigate the risk of exposure to the virus.
We need the support of: Designers, IT (Architects, Systems Administrators, Developers (Web / Mobile)), Legal (Creating associations, Digital World, GDPR), Finance (Transactions, Digital Payments / Receipts), Marketing (Disclosure, Copywrite ), Health (Epidimeologists, Doctors, Nurses and Assistants), General Support.
For those interested, join our server on Discord: https://discord.gg/JSX analyzedf
We suggest you start by reading channel # a-ler and share a message with your skills and how you can contribute to the project on channel #competencias.
As soon as possible, they will be associated with positions. " (in Portuguese)
